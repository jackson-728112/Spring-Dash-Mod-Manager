# Spring-Dash-Mod-Manager
A mod manager for Spring Dash
---
How To Use
- to use the software create a folder on the root of Spring Dash called "mods"
- inside this folder place any mods (make sure to maintain the name for example Mods/Easy-Snow/... and not have it be Mods/...
- Run the program and click yes when steam asks to run with a modified pck
---
How it works
- the program takes all the mods in your mods folder and combines them into a folder called pak
- using GDRE tools this folder is patched into Spring Dashes pck file
- the game is launched using the modified pck as opposed to the original one
